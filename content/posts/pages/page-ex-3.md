+ Roots of  quadratic equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ can be obtained using \
$$\tag{1}
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
$$
which is known as quadratic formula.
+ The term $D = b^2 - 4ac$ is the discriminant, that indicates whether there are two roots, or only one root exists, or none real root exists.
